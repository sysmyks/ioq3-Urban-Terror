This work requires a specific map depot. 
It won't work with urt.li; 
you need to replace the 'q3ut4' folder with 'download.' 
For example: <url>/download/map.pk3. 
The compilation doesn't work on Windows.
Also, if you encounter any problems with your bot-rcon, 
try running it with this command: 

+set fs_game q3ut4 +set dedicated 2 +set net_port 27960 +set com_hunkmegs 256 +exec server.cfg

You will find the games.log file in the user's directory, 
for example: ~/.q3a/q3ut4/games.log.
